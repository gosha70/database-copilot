# Logo Directory

This directory is used to store logo images for the Database Copilot application.

## How to Add a Logo

You can add a logo in two ways:

1. **Through the UI**: 
   - Navigate to the application in your browser
   - In the sidebar, find the "Logo Settings" section
   - Use the file uploader to upload a PNG, JPG, or JPEG image
   - The image will be saved in this directory with the name "logo.[extension]"

2. **Manually**:
   - Place any image file in this directory
   - For automatic detection, name your file with "logo" in the filename (e.g., "logo.png", "database_logo.jpg")
   - If no file with "logo" in the name is found, the application will use the first image file it finds in this directory
   - If no image is found, a default database emoji (üóÑÔ∏è) will be used

## Recommended Logo Specifications

- **Format**: PNG or JPEG
- **Size**: 50x50 pixels (the image will be resized to this size in the UI)
- **Background**: Transparent background (PNG) works best
- **Content**: A simple, recognizable icon that represents database operations or migrations
