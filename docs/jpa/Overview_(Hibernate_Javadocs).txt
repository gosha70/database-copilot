Hibernate Javadoc (6.2.36.Final)
Hibernate ORM Javadocs
Hibernate is a library for object/relation mapping (ORM). It provides:
a
native API
centered around
SessionFactory
and
Session
,
an implementation of the
Java (or Jakarta) Persistence API
(JPA),
        where the equivalent central interfaces are
EntityManagerFactory
and
EntityManager
,
a set of
mapping annotations
which augment the O/R mapping annotations defined
        by JPA, and which may be used with either API, and
compile-time tooling
for writing more type-safe code.
Native API
Along with
SessionFactory
and
Session
, applications
    using the native API will often make use of the following interfaces:
Configuration
to configure and bootstrap Hibernate,
StatelessSession
for processes involving many entity instances,
Cache
to manage the second-level cache,
Transaction
to control local transactions,
Query
to execute HQL queries,
NativeQuery
to execute native SQL queries,
Filter
to manage filters,
HibernateCriteriaBuilder
to construct criteria queries,
        and
SchemaManager
to execute DDL in tests.
JPA
The JPA interfaces are defined by the JPA specification. For details see the latest
specification
along with the
API documentation
for the package
jakarta.persistence
.
Note that since Hibernate 5.2, the native API extends the JPA API rather than wrapping it.
    For example,
SessionFactory
extends
EntityManagerFactory
, and
Session
extends
EntityManager
.
It's always possible to fall back from JPA interfaces to native APIs, by calling
entityManager.unwrap(Session.class)
,
entityManagerFactory.unwrap(SessionFactory.class)
,
    or
query.unwrap(Query.class)
. In certain cases
    it's also possible to access native functionality by passing a
JPA-defined
or
Hibernate-defined
hint, at the cost of a
    loss of type-safety.
These packages define additional extensions to the JPA APIs:
org.hibernate.query.criteria
packages extensions to
jakarta.persistence.criteria
, and
org.hibernate.metamodel.model.domain
packages extensions to
jakarta.persistence.metamodel
.
Mapping annotations
The mapping annotations defined by the JPA specification provide a foundation for expressing
    object/relational mappings in Hibernate and other JPA implementations.
The annotations in the package
org.hibernate.annotations
extend this foundation and
    accommodate more specialized requirements. These annotation are not tied to the native API,
    and may be used in conjunction with the JPA API.
The full power of Hibernate can only be unlocked via judicious use of these extra annotations.
XML-based mappings
Annotation-based mappings are the best choice for most users, but Hibernate offers XML-based
mappings as an alternative.
The JPA-standard XML schema is
orm_3_0.xsd
.
Hibernate extends this schema with some additional mapping elements. The extended schema is
mapping-3.1.0.xsd
.
Prior to the existence of JPA, Hibernate had its own format for XML-based mappings,
        which still works, though it has not been improved in a long time. The DTD is
hibernate-mapping-3.0.dtd
Bootstrapping Hibernate
There are four basic ways to obtain an instance of Hibernate:
as a JPA
persistence provider
, by using
Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(java.lang.String)
,
by using the "simplified"
Configuration
API,
for those who enjoy dirty hands, by using the APIs in
org.hibernate.boot
, or
in a
container environment
like
WildFly
or
Quarkus
,
        by letting the container take care of the bootstrap process and of injecting the
EntityManagerFactory
or
SessionFactory
.
All major Java application servers and microservice frameworks come with built-in support for
    Hibernate. Such container environments also typically feature facilities to automatically
    manage the lifecycle of a
EntityManager
or
Session
and its association with
    container-managed transactions.
Example configuration files for JPA and native usage may be found
here
. A comprehensive list of configuration properties understood by Hibernate may be found in
    the class
AvailableSettings
. Most sensible programs will only ever need
    to use a tiny handful of them.
Popular extension points
Hibernate offers an enormous wealth of extension points for customizing almost any aspect of
    its implementation. Most of these extension points are far too technical to be of interest to
    the typical application developer.
However, the following extension points are of quite general interest:
org.hibernate.boot.model.naming
allows the quantity of repetitive O/R mapping
        metadata to be minimized via the use of naming strategies,
org.hibernate.type.descriptor.jdbc
and
org.hibernate.type.descriptor.java
contain the built-in
JdbcType
s and
JavaType
s for "compositional" basic
        attribute type mappings,
org.hibernate.usertype
defines support for user-defined custom attribute types,
org.hibernate.generator
defines support for generated attribute values,
org.hibernate.context.spi
defines support for context-bound "current" sessions
        and contextual multi-tenancy, and
org.hibernate.binder
allows for user-defined mapping annotations.
More advanced extension points include:
org.hibernate.dialect
provides a framework for modelling dialects of SQL,
org.hibernate.cache.spi
defines an SPI for integrating with second-level cache
        providers,
org.hibernate.engine.jdbc.connections.spi
defines an SPI for integrating with
        JDBC connection pools.
Finally, Hibernate ORM Core is itself a framework for advanced extensions like Hibernate Search,
    Hibernate Reactive, and Envers, which do much more than just implementing a single well-defined
    extension point. The starting points for such extensions are found in the packages
org.hibernate.integrator.spi
and
org.hibernate.event.spi
.
Package categories
The organization of code into packages is based on the following classification:
API packages
include classes and interfaces which are used directly by
        a typical application. These packages never have
spi
nor
internal
in their name, and are not under the namespace
org.hibernate.testing
.
SPI packages
include classes and interfaces which are used by integrators,
        library developers, and framework developers to develop extensions to Hibernate, or to alter
        its behavior in some way. These packages usually have
spi
in their name.
Some classes and interfaces are considered part of the internal implementation of Hibernate.
        This category includes packages with
internal
in their name, along with any class
        or interface annotated
@Internal
. Clients should avoid depending
        directly on these types.
The
hibernate-testing
module, and the namespace
org.hibernate.testing
contain
testing support
used in the Hibernate test suite.
