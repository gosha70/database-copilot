# Theme Switching in Database Copilot

This document explains how to use the theme switching feature in Database Copilot and provides information about the recent improvements to the dark mode implementation.

## Using Theme Switching

Database Copilot supports both light and dark themes. You can switch between them using the theme selector in the sidebar:

1. Look for the "Appearance Settings" section in the sidebar
2. Under "Theme", select either "Light" or "Dark" from the dropdown
3. The application will immediately switch to the selected theme

## Customizing Colors

In addition to switching between light and dark themes, you can also customize the colors used in the application:

1. Under "Colors" in the sidebar, you'll find three color pickers:
   - **Primary Color**: Used for buttons, active tabs, and other primary UI elements
   - **Secondary Color**: Used for secondary UI elements like file upload buttons
   - **Text Color**: Used for text throughout the application

2. Click on any of the color pickers to select a custom color
3. The application will immediately update to use your selected colors

## Dark Mode Improvements

The dark mode implementation has been improved to provide a more consistent and visually appealing experience:

1. **Comprehensive Styling**: All UI elements now properly respect the dark theme, including:
   - Text inputs and text areas
   - Select boxes and dropdowns
   - Expanders and code blocks
   - Tabs and buttons
   - Checkboxes and file uploaders
   - Tables and dataframes

2. **Improved Contrast**: Better contrast ratios for improved readability

3. **Consistent Colors**: Consistent use of colors throughout the application

4. **Border Styling**: Proper border styling for UI elements in dark mode

## Technical Implementation

The theme switching is implemented using CSS variables and selectors that target Streamlit's UI components. When the user selects a theme from the dropdown, the application applies the appropriate set of CSS rules:

### Dark Theme Variables

```css
:root {
    --background-color: #121212;
    --text-color: #E0E0E0;
    --secondary-background-color: #1E1E1E;
    --border-color: #333333;
    --widget-background: #2C2C2C;
    --widget-border: #444444;
}
```

### Light Theme Variables

```css
:root {
    --background-color: #FFFFFF;
    --text-color: #333333;
    --secondary-background-color: #F0F2F6;
    --border-color: #CCCCCC;
    --widget-background: #FFFFFF;
    --widget-border: #DDDDDD;
}
```

These variables are then applied to various UI elements using CSS selectors with `!important` flags to ensure they override any default styling.

The theme switching mechanism works by:

1. Applying a unique ID to each theme's style block (`id="dark_theme"` or `id="light_theme"`)
2. Explicitly setting all the same UI elements for both themes to ensure consistency
3. Using CSS variables for colors to maintain a consistent color scheme

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the theme switching:

1. **Theme Not Applying**: Try refreshing the page after selecting a theme
2. **Inconsistent Styling**: Some UI elements might not be properly styled in dark mode. Please report these issues so they can be fixed.
3. **Color Picker Not Working**: Make sure you're clicking on the color picker itself, not the label

## Future Improvements

Planned improvements for the theme switching feature:

1. **Theme Persistence**: Remember the user's theme preference across sessions
2. **More Theme Options**: Add more pre-defined themes beyond just light and dark
3. **Custom Theme Creation**: Allow users to create and save custom themes
