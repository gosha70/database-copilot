# Database Copilot Enhancement Plan

This directory contains the detailed enhancement plan for implementing a production-ready LLM cascade flow and performance improvements in the Database Copilot application.

## Contents

- [enhancement-plan.md](enhancement-plan.md) - The main document containing the comprehensive implementation plan

## Overview

The enhancement plan focuses on two main areas:

1. **Production-Grade LLM Cascade Design** - A 3-tier cascade system that prioritizes information sources in this order:
   - Internal Guidelines (highest priority)
   - Example Migrations (high priority)
   - Official Liquibase Documentation (medium priority)

2. **Performance Improvement Strategy** - Several optimizations to improve response time and efficiency:
   - Caching and Memoization
   - Asynchronous Processing
   - Model Optimization
   - Input Optimization
   - External LLM Integration Option

## Implementation Roadmap

The plan proposes a phased implementation approach:

1. **Phase 1: Cascade Retrieval System**
2. **Phase 2: Performance Optimizations**
3. **Phase 3: External Integration (Optional)**

## How to Use This Plan

This enhancement plan serves as a detailed blueprint for implementing the proposed changes. Development teams can:

1. Use the code examples as a starting point for implementation
2. Follow the phased roadmap to prioritize work
3. Refer to the testing strategy to validate improvements
4. Use the diagrams to understand the architecture and data flow

## Next Steps

1. Review the enhancement plan with the development team
2. Prioritize features based on business needs
3. Create tickets/issues for each implementation phase
4. Begin implementation following the proposed roadmap
