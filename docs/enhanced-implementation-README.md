# Enhanced Database Copilot Implementation

This directory contains the enhanced implementation of the Database Copilot, featuring a production-ready LLM cascade flow and performance improvements.

## Overview

The enhanced implementation includes:

1. **LLM Cascade Flow** - A priority-based retrieval system that ensures company-specific guidelines take precedence over generic best practices.
2. **Performance Optimizations** - Caching, parallel processing, and model optimization techniques to improve response time.
3. **Streamlit Compatibility** - Special handling to avoid issues with Streamlit's module inspection system.

## Installation

Before using the enhanced implementation, make sure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
# Install dependencies
./install_dependencies.py
```

## Usage

### Testing the Enhanced Implementation

You can test the enhanced implementation using the provided test script:

```bash
# Run the test script
./test_enhanced_reviewer.py --migration examples/20250505-create-custom-table.yaml
```

This will:
1. Review the migration with both the original and enhanced reviewers
2. Compare the results to highlight differences
3. Save both reviews to the `reviews/` directory for detailed comparison

### Using the Enhanced Reviewer in Your Code

To use the enhanced reviewer in your code:

```python
from backend.models.enhanced_liquibase_reviewer import EnhancedLiquibaseReviewer

# Initialize the reviewer
reviewer = EnhancedLiquibaseReviewer()

# Review a migration
migration_content = "..."  # Your migration content
format_type = "yaml"  # or "xml"
review = reviewer.review_migration(migration_content, format_type)

print(review)
```

### Benchmarking Performance

You can benchmark the performance of the enhanced implementation using the provided benchmark script:

```bash
# Run the benchmark script
python docs/benchmark_example.py --migration examples/20250505-create-custom-table.yaml
```

This will output a table comparing the performance of different implementations.

## Implementation Details

### LLM Cascade Flow

The cascade retriever prioritizes information sources in this order:
1. Internal Guidelines (highest priority)
2. Example Migrations (high priority)
3. Official Liquibase Documentation (medium priority)

This ensures that company-specific guidelines take precedence over generic best practices, while still leveraging all available information sources.

### Performance Optimizations

The implementation includes several performance optimizations:
- Caching for embeddings, vector search results, and LLM responses
- Parallel processing using ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent retrieval
- Model optimization with quantization options
- Smart input processing with targeted queries

### Streamlit Compatibility

To address compatibility issues with Streamlit, the implementation includes:
- A streamlit_compatibility.py module that safely imports PyTorch and other libraries
- Thread-based parallel processing instead of asyncio
- Fallback mechanisms for when imports fail

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Dependencies

If you encounter errors about missing modules, run the dependency installer:

```bash
./install_dependencies.py
```

### Streamlit Errors

If you encounter errors with Streamlit related to PyTorch or asyncio, make sure you're using the streamlit_compatibility module:

```python
from backend.models.streamlit_compatibility import get_safe_llm, get_safe_embedding_model
```

### Performance Issues

If you experience performance issues:
1. Check if you're using the cached versions of the LLM and embedding models
2. Ensure you're using the parallel retriever for concurrent queries
3. Consider using a smaller or more optimized model
