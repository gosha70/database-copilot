# Example Files

This directory contains example files that can be used to test the Database Copilot application.

## Liquibase Migrations

- `example_migration.xml`: An example Liquibase migration in XML format that creates a customers table, an addresses table with a foreign key to customers, and indexes for better performance.
- `example_migration.yaml`: The same migration as above, but in YAML format.

## Usage

You can use these example files to test the review functionality of the Database Copilot application. Simply upload one of these files in the "Review Migration" tab of the application to see how the review process works.

You can also modify these files to test different scenarios or create your own migration files based on these examples.
